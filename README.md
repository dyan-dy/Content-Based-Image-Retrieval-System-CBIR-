Content Based Image Retrieval System(CBIR)

This is a student work done in Vision Image and Processing course. The main idea of content based image retrieval system is to use SIFT method and K-means to get feature vectors. We then use mean reciprocal rank and how often (in per cent) the correct category is in top-3 for evaluation of our system.
